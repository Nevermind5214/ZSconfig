# ZSconfig
A feature-rich and modular csgo config that's actually useful.

Please carefully review the contents of the files because it WILL change your game settings,
you might lose your esoteric mouse sensitivity number or your surf binds etc.

Install:
1. put the files into whereveryouhavesteaminstalled\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg
2. add "-novid -nojoy -exec autoexec" to launch options in steam(without the quotation marks)
3. ???
4. Profit!
