# ZSconfig
A feature-rich and modular csgo config that's actually useful.

Install:
1. put the files into whereveryouhavesteaminstalled\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg
2. add "-novid -nojoy -exec autoexec" to launch options in steam(without the quotation marks)
3. ???
4. Profit!
